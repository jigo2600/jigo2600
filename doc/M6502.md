# The 6507 CPU

[TOC]

## Overview

There is extensive literature on the 6502 CPU (and related CPUs such as the 6507), so this document focuses mostly on some tricky details concerning its emulation. As an introduction to the M6502 ISA, as well as detailed cycle-accurate descriptions of each instruction, one can refer to:

* The Synertek's [6502 manual](http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/synertek_programming_manual.pdf).

## Clock

The CPU is driven by an external clock signal $\Phi_0$. Internally, the CPU generates two additional clocks: $\Phi_2$, which is a slightly-delayed version of $\Phi_0$, and  $\Phi_1$, which is roughly in opposition of phase with $\Phi_2$. The pair $(\Phi_1,\Phi_2)$ forms a *dual-phase clock*, used to synchronise operations.

## Buses and timings 

The M6502 CPU data bus is 8 bit wide and the address bus 16 bit wide, although the M6507 CPU exposes only 13 address bits.

A CPU clock cycle is divided in two halves. During the first half, phase $\Phi_1=1$ is active, the CPU sets the address bus and the `Rw` line to initiate a read/write operation. During the second half, phase $\Phi_2=1$ is active, the CPU keeps the address bus and `Rw` line constant, and either reads or sets the data bus. All such events are triggered by phase levels, not edges. So, for example, the address bus changes over the course of the first half-cycle, not just at the edge between first and second half, and the data bus is modified or read continuously for the duration of the second half.

**Stalling.** The hardware can stall the CPU by lowering the `RDY` line during the first half of the clock cycle, while the CPU is setting the address and the `Rw` line . If this occurs during a read cycle (`Rw` set to high), during the second half of the clock  the CPU assumes that the data on the bus is not in a "ready" state and thus does not read it; instead, it repeats the current clock cycle once more to try to fetch the data again. Stalling does not occur during a write cycle, however.

## Instruction execution

The CPU executes instruction by moving data around several internal registers and buses. The steps are coordinated by a micro-controller which breaks the execution of each instruction into multiple clock cycles. Steps are numbered as $T=0,1,2,...$ up to some maximum which is instruction-dependent (the shortest instruction take two clocks to execute).

Step $T=0$ is the *fetch cycle*. During this cycle the opcode of the next instruction to execute is read from memory, but the *instruction register* (IR) still contains the code of the *current* instruction. Hence $T=0$ is used to finish the execution of the current instruction. The next instruction effectively starts executing at $T=1$, when the IR is updated.

Due to the dual-phase clock design, registers is updated (latched) during a phase during which their inputs are held constant. For example,  if $R_2$ is a register updated during phase $\Phi_2$ as a function $R_2 \leftarrow f(R_1)$ of register $R_1$, then $R_1$ is held constant during $\Phi_2$. Hence, at any point in time, the data paths formed in the CPU follow this rule.

The instruction register IR is updated during phase $\Phi_1$ (the first half of the clock cycle) of $T=1$. Hence the micro-controller starts executing the new instruction already in this phase. In some cases (e.g. `ORA`), however, the previous instructions can **spill** in the first half of the $T=1$ cycle to complete some register updates. This is often the case when the ALU was used during $T=0$, updating the internal register ADD. During the first half-cycle of $T=1$, the content of ADD may need to be transferred back to the accumulator or to some other register. Since this action depends on the previous instruction whose opcode is overwritten during $T=1$, the micro-controller must have additional state to remember the previous instruction a while longer.

## Arithmetic

### Binary additions and subtractions

**Additions** involve two 8-bit operands $a$ and $b$ and the binary carry $c$ and results in the quantity $s=a+b+c$.  An *unsigned overflow* turns on the output carry bit `c`; it occurs when the sum $s> 255$ is too large. A  *signed overflow* turns on the overflow bit `v`; it occurs when the result $s$, interpreted as the sum of  two modulo-2 signed quantities, cannot be represented in 8 bits:

* if $a,b \ge 0$, then $s \geq 0$ and there is signed overflow if $s > 127$.
* if $a,b < 0$, then $s < 0$ and there is signed overflow if $s < -128$.
* if $a< 0, b \geq 0$ or if $a \geq 0, b < 0$, then $-128 \leq s \leq 127$ and there is no signed overflow.

Hence, there is signed overflow when values $a$ and $b$ have the *same* sign *and* the summation $s$ has a different sign. This can be easily tested by checking the sign bit (bit 7), as follows:

    s = a + b + c
    v = (sign(a) == sign(b)) and (sign(a) != sign(s))
      = not(a[7] xor b[7]) and (a[7] xor s[7])

**Subtractions** are similar to additions, but compute the quantity $d = a - b - (c - 1 )$ (note that the carry bit is flipped). An *unsigned overflow* occurs when the difference $d$ is a negative number; however, unsigned overflow turns *off* the carry bit `c` instead of turning it on as for the addition. The *signed overflow* turns on the overflow bit `v` as before and is determined as follows:

* if $a <  0, b \geq 0$: then $-256 \leq d \leq -1$ and there is  overflow if $d < -128$.
* if $a \geq 0,b <  0$ : then $0 \leq d \leq 255$ and there is, overflow if $d > 127$.
* if $a,b\geq 0$ or $a,b<0$, then $-128 \leq d \leq 127$ and there is no overflow.

Hence, there is a signed overflow when values $a$ and $b$ have *different* signs *and* the difference $s$ has not the same sign a $a$. This can be tested as follows:

    d = a - b - (c - 1)
    v = (sign(a) != sign(b)) and (signa(a) != sign(d))
      = (a[7] xor b[7]) and (a[7] xor s[7])

### BCD additions and subtractions

Let $a=16 \cdot a_1 + a_0$ be a 8 bit number decomposed in first and second nibble $a_0$ and $a_1$ and similarly for $b$.  The **BCD addition** of $a$ and $b$ is obtained by interpreting each nibble as a decimal digit in the range 0 to 9. If $s= a + b + c$ is the *binary sum*, the BCD sum is given by:
$$
\begin{align*}
s_\text{BCD} &= 16^2 \cdot q + 16\cdot (a_1+b_1+z-10\cdot q) + (b_0+a_0+c-10\cdot z - w\cdot 16)
\\
&= s + 16 \cdot 6 \cdot q + 6 \cdot  z  - w\cdot 16
\\
z &= \begin{cases}
1, & a_0+b_0+c \geq 10, \\
0, & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\\
w &= \begin{cases}
1, & a_0+b_0+c \geq 26 , \\
0, & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\\
q &= \begin{cases}
1, & a_1+b_1+z \geq 10, \\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$
The expression above shows how to adjust the binary sum $s$ to obtain the BCD sum $s$ by computing bits $z,w,q$. The bit $w$ is always zero if the two numbers are properly-coded BCD values and it is needed only to simulate the 6502 behavior when invalid numbers are summed.

In oder to determine bits $z,w$, one needs to determine whether $a_0 + b_0 + c$ is greater or equal to $\tau = 10,26,$ which requires to extract this quantity from the binary sum $s$. All the bits of this sum can be read from $s$ immediately except the carry bit $k$. This is mixed in the fifth bit of the sum as `s[4] = a[4] + b[4] + k`. Hence $k$ can be recovered as `s[4] - a[4] - b[4]` . Using 1-bit modular arithmetic, this is the same as `s[4] + a[4] + b[4] = s[4] xor a[4] xor b[4]`.

The **BCD subtraction** is obtained from the *binary difference* $d = a - b - (1-c)$ in a similar manner:
$$
\begin{align*}
d_\text{BCD} &=  - 16^2 \cdot q + 16\cdot (a_1 - b_1 - z+ 10\cdot q) + (a_0 - b_0 - (1 - c) + 10\cdot z + 16\cdot w)
\\
&= d - 16 \cdot 6 \cdot q - 6 \cdot  z  - w\cdot 16
\\
z &= \begin{cases}
1, & a_0 - b_0 - (1 - c) < 0, \\
0, & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\\
w &= \begin{cases}
1, & a_0+b_0+c \leq 21, \\
0, & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\\
q &= \begin{cases}
1, & a_1 - b_1 - z < 0, \\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

As before, we need to extract the quantity  $a_0 - b_0 - (1-c)$ from the binary difference $d$; this requires to find the carry bit $k$ resulting from this operation. The latter is mixed in the fifth bit `d[4]` of the difference as `d[4] = a[4] - b[4] - k`. Hence $k$ can be recovered as `s[4] - a[4] + b[4]` . Using 1-bit modular arithmetic, this is the same as `s[4] + a[4] + b[4] = s[4] xor a[4] xor b[4]`, which is the same formula found for addition.

## M6507 variant

The M6507 CPU is a variant of the M6502 CPU used in the Atari 2600. The  M6507 package has only 13 address pins, so the *address bus* is 13 bits wide (but internally address are still 16 bits and the *data bus* is still 8 bits wide). There are no IRQ lines either, so no IRQ can be raised by the hardware.

## Simulation

The M6502 simulator is advanced by a call to the `cycle()` method. This function simulates a whole clock cycle, starting with $\Phi_1=1$ and terminating with $\Phi_2=1$. 

In term of the **bus operation**, this means that by the end of `cycle()`, the new address/`Rw` setting has been generated (these can be accessed using `getRw()` and `getAddressBus()`); for a write operation, the new data is also available on the bus (access using `getDataBus()`). For a write operation, the CPU is expecting the new data during $\Phi_2=1$; however, since this is not supposed to be stable until the next cycle starts, the CPU does *not* use this data during the cycle just simulated. Rather, one simply calls `setDataBus()` *after* `cycle()` so that the new data is available for the *next* call to `cycle()`.

In order to simulate **stalling**, `cycle(bool ready)` takes the `ready` line as additional parameter. The value of `ready` refers to the read operation initiated in the *previous* call to `cycle()`. When `cycle(false)` is called, the CPU assumes that the data on the bus is not yet available and repeats the previous cycle again, stalling.

### Undocumented instructions

The simulator implements all undocumented opcodes as well. However, some of these differ significantly depending on the underlying CPU variant and manufacturer. The simulator [reproduces Visual 6502's behavior](#testing-against -visual-6502) with a few exceptions where behaviors closer to actual hardware are preferred.

## Testing against Visual 6502

[Visual 6502](http://visual6502.org) is a transitor-level emulation of the M6502 CPU. This emulator matches all documented and most undocumented opcodes' behaviour in Visual 6502, with a handful of exceptions mostly irrelevant to applicaitons:

* **`P` register.** The status register `P` matches Visual 6502 only when a $T=1$ cycle is emulated. This is due to simplifications in the emulator.

* **`S` register.** The stack register is generally exactly emulated, but the value may differ from Visual 6502 during the execution of `RTS`, `RTI`, and `BRK`. This is because in real hardware these instruction use the `S` register to store temporary values during their execution.

* **`ANC #$hh`, `ALR #$hh`, `ARR #$hh`.**  Visual 6502 does not implement the `and` operation that should be performed on real hardware with these instructions. Thus these match the simulator only on immediate argument `#$ff`, which makes the `and` irrelevant.

* **`LAX #$hh`**. Only `LAX #$00` works as expected.

* **`XAA`**. This opcode is thoroughly discussed in the Visual 6502 page.

* **`LAS`**. Visual 6502's behavior appear to differ from what published in the literature. We could reproduce its behavior in full using the pseudo-code:

  ```C++
    X = S ;
    setNZ(S & dataBus) ;
    A = (S & (dataBus | 0x11)) ;
  ```

  This should be contrast with the expected behaviour:

  ```c++
  setNZ(X = (A = (S &= dataBus))) ; 
  ```
