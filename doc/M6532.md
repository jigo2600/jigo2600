# M6532 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA)

[TOC]

The M6532 (also called PIA for *Peripheral Interface Adapter* or RIOT for *RAM Input Output Timer*) coprocessor contains the system RAM, a timer, and two 8-bit IO ports, used in the Atari2600 to read joystick buttons and console switches. A very good, concise description of this chip is provided by its [data sheet](http://www.ionpool.net/arcade/gottlieb/technical/datasheets/R6532_datasheet.pdf).

The PIA has two IRQ flags (timer and PA7) and, separately, two corresponding IRQ enable bits controlling an IRQ line on the CPU. However, since the M6507 CPU does not have an input IRQ line at all, the IRQ generation is irrelevant in the Atari 2600.

### PIA pinout

- **Data.** D0-D7 data bus, PA0-PA7 and PB0-PB7 ports (i/o).
- **Addressing.** A0-A6 address bus, $\overline{\text{RS}}$ RAM select, $\text{CS1}$, $\overline{\text{CS2}}$ chip select (input). $\text{CS1}$, $\overline{\text{CS2}}$ are connected to M6507's A7 and A12 respectively, resulting in the condition A7=1 and A12=0 to address the PIA overall. $\overline{\text{RS}}$ is connected to A9, resulting in the condition A9=0 to address the RAM and A9=1 to address the ports and registers.
- $\Phi_2$ clock (see the M6507) (input).
- $\text{R}/\overline{\text{W}}$ (input).
- $\overline{\text{IRQ}}$ interrupt request; not connected in the Atari2600, hence irrelevant (output).
- $\overline{\text{RES}}$ reset (input).
